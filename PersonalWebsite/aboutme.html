I have also worked on multiple software projects and had lots of experience collaborating with other programmers. Most importantly, I developed the ability to quickly pick up new skills and technologies, and adapt to the requirements of a given project.</div></div>

I worked with a small team of computer science students and was tasked with conducting research on a cutting edge simulation technology called the Entity Component System. My role on the team was to test the maturity of this technology on the game engine platform Unity. I developed simulations using ECS technology and created complex behaviors for the entities such as movement and pathfinding. The scripts of the simulations were written in C#, which I had no prior experience with, but I was able to learn it as necessary in order to complete the project. By the end of the project, I developed a simulation that demonstrated how the new ECS technology could simulate over 1000x more entities with complex behaviors than the simulation technology that CAE was previously using. This research was presented to CAE and they were extremely satisfied with the results. Here are some of the technical skills that I gained through this experience:<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Technical skills:
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>Development using Unity</li>
                                            <li>C# experience</li>
                                            <li>Github for version control</li>
                                            <li>Agile development methods used by the team</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            In addition to all the technical knowledge that I gained, I also improved many of my soft skills. In our small development team, we each had some secondary roles. My role was the meeting scribe and I was additionally responsible for keeping meeting minutes for our weekly meetings with CAE, send out a weekly memo to update CAE on our accomplishments for the week and upcoming plans, and also write up other documentation that was required for our project. This greatly improved my writing skills and my ability to be attentive during meetings. Our team was also required to give several professional presentations throughout the course of this project where my public speaking and presentation skills were greatly improved. At the end of the project, my team was required to provide a final whitepaper detailing all the research and recommendations that we have collected. This whitepaper ended up being over 40 pages long with 5 separate volumes of content to which CAE was very happy about.<br>Here are a list of some of the soft skills that I improved through this experience:

                                            <br>
                                            Soft skills:
                                            <ul>

                                            I was manager of the team for the first year and took upon several initiatives such as handling logistics, opening a bank account, and managing team financials.
                                            I became captain of the team the second year and was responsible for conducting weekly practices for over 20 undergraduates, creating choreogrophy, and taking initiative on
                                            the team's various activites. 
                                            As captain, I also helped lead the team into many firsts such as: 
                                            <br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Traveling nationally for competitions</li>
                                                <li>Delegate responsibilities by setting up an executive board</li>
                                                <li>Placing first at a competition in Oklahoma</li>
                                            </ul> 

                                            I am no longer part of the team as I have graduated from college, but the team is now under new leadership and is continuing to grow to compete at higher level competitions. 
                                            Overall, this experience has greatly developed my ability and skills to be a leader, and has given me real-world experience in leading a team to complete a shared goal.
