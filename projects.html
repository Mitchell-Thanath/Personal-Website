                                            <p>As part of my Programming Language Concepts course, I had the task of developing a programming language from scratch in Java. I followed a set of predefined grammar rules and created 
                                                the various cruical components of a programming language.
                                                To begin with, I constructed a Lexer, responsible for converting source code into a sequence of tokens. Next, I created a Parser, which parsed the token stream and transformed it 
                                                into an abstract syntax tree (AST). I then made an Interpreter to execute the program by traversing the AST, evaluating statements, and producing results in accordance with the 
                                                language's semantics. I then constructed an Analyzer which ensured type safety, detected potential errors, and validated the correctness of the program. Finally, I created the 
                                                Generator which generated the final code by mapping it to Java. From the completion of this project and implementing the Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, Analyzer, and Generator, I gained
                                                a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of programming languages and their various components. Here are some of my other takeaways from the project:

                                            <p>The Shared Car Locator is a project in C++ designed to assist users in finding available shared cars within a specified radius of their chosen location. This program utilizes a dataset 
                                                consisting of over 100,000 tuples, containing information about shared cars in Tel Aviv, such as location, model, color, and more. To efficiently store and access the dataset,
                                                 I implemented a map data structure. The project incorporates the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), for easy user interaction with the shared car map. The project works by 
                                                 having the user click on a location on the map as their intended position. Then, the project uses a function that takes the user-selected location coordinates as input parameters and 
                                                 returns the closest 'x' number of cars based on distance calculation. In order to enhance the project's performance, I optimized the algorithm and reduced its time complexity. As a
                                                 result, the program's execution time was significantly improved with the runtime decreasing from approximately 4 minutes to around 2 minutes.
                                                Here are my biggest takeaways from this project:

                                                standard features of Minesweeper such as generation of mines, flagging, recursive mine reveal, and game result 
                                                feedback. Additionally, it contains some extra components such as custom game boards and mine counts allowing

                                                and a score board to display players' performance. I utilized the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) to 
                                                develop the user interface and graphics of the game. This project involved the creation of various functions and

                                            <p> As part of a team project, we created a job board website where employers can post job opportunities and students could post that they are seeking a position.
                                                All these posts were stored in a database and displayed on the feed of the webpage. We also implemented additional features such as a search bar to search for 
                                                posts, a comment feature where you can comment on posts, and an upvote feature where you could upvote or downvote posts. We also allowed the sorting of posts on the users 
                                                feed by number of upvotes, or by recency of the listing. 
                                                Our team used Figma for prototyping/designing the webpage and we used React to implement the website. We also used MongoDB for our database to store the
                                                posts, and we used Bootstrap for some of the styles of the components.
